## About

With over 6 years of experience, I design user-friendly digital products that align with business goals and deliver value to users. At Kaartje2go.nl, I develop practical design systems and clear interfaces with Figma, and leverage AI-powered prototyping tools like Cursor, to quickly test and validate new ideas.

My approach is practical and goal-oriented: I make complex problems understandable and deliver concrete solutions. I work best in environments with short communication lines, direct feedback, and clear structure, ensuring my designs provide immediate value for users.
